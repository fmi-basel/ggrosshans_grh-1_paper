# ggjw-data

This is currently used as repository for *trained models* and *test
data* for https://github.com/fmi-basel/ggrosshans-jobsystem-workflows.

The minimal jobsystem hosted for the Grosshans lab on vcl1048 relies
on this data! Do not delete/modify without getting in touch with
Markus Rempfler first.
