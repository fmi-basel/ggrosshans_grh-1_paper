TO DO LIST
==========


Things that need code in GitHub
-------------------------------

* RNAPII mRNA-seq & ChIP-seq experiment:
- processing: RNAPII to promoter counts
- processing: mRNA to gene counts
- analysis: osc promoter calling 
=> Fig 1A: heatmap
- analysis: corr bw RNAPII ChIP-seq & mRNA-seq
=> Fig X

* GRH-1 ChIP-seq
- processing: peaks, motifs 
=> Fig X: motif, frac BS/P w/ P/BS
- analysis: osc, then phase enrichment analysis
=> Fig X


Additionally
------------

* Write into README
* Luciferase Assay Analyser repos
 

Not GitHub-related
------------------

* GEO submission
